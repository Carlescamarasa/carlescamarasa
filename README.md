- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python to better understand the logic of coding.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects related with music, AI, Data Science or automation tools for musicians.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with coding, since I'm very new on this world.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about music, trumpet, practice strategies, psychology of performance... I'll be happy to nerdly talk about it!
